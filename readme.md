AITestPlaform is built as an easy-to-use training/testing/fine-tuning plaform for neural network models based on the Tensorflow framework. The idea is to use a single test run toml file for users to define all tunable parameters of a neural network model, and automatically obtain the results after training/testing/fine-tuning. For more info., please refer to the wiki page.
